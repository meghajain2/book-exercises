# Exercise 3
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far. In particular, you should include the following:

- A _heading_ with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

# Change directory: cd

```
cd "u of wa"
```

- This will change directories from the desktop down to the "u of wa folder". You will be able to access everything in that folder now.

There are also other ways of using **cd**:
- ```cd``` -> this goes down a folder
- ```cd ..``` -> this goes up a folder
- ```cd ~``` -> this goes back to the home directory
- ```cd "desktop/u of wa/info 201/"``` -> this is an absolute path

- **cd desktop/u\ of\ wa/info\ 201/** -> this is an absolute path
