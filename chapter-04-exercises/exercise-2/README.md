# Change directory: cd

> EX: cd "u of wa"

- This will change directories from the desktop down to the "u of wa folder". You will be able to access everything in that folder now.

There are also other ways of using **cd**
- **cd** -> this goes down a folder
- **cd ..** -> this goes up a folder
- **cd ~** -> this goes back to the home directory
- **cd desktop/u\ of\ wa/info\ 201/** -> this is an absolute path
